# Bases Charts

This plugin for Obsidian adds three new bases views: Scatter Charts, Line Charts, and Bar Charts.

## Usage

First you need a [Base](https://help.obsidian.md/bases), then from there you can (with the plugin installed and enabled) create thee new bases views: Scatter Charts, Line Charts, and Bar Charts.
Next you need to select the property or formula used for the X axis, in the view settings.
On the X axis, [`Number`, `Date`, and `String`](https://help.obsidian.md/bases/functions) are supported.
Then you can select which properties to display on the Y Axis using the Base's `Properties` menu (top right).
It is recommended that you disable the default activated file name.
On the Y axis the plugin only supports values of type [`Number`](https://help.obsidian.md/bases/functions).

### Grouping and Multiple Charts

The plugin supports grouping data points by color and spliting them into multiple charts.

The view settings (in the Base's view menu, top left) include a `Multi chart mode` dropdown.
The avaiable options are `Separate by group` and `Separate by property`.

Separating by group will use a `Group by` sort (Base's `Sort` menu, top right) to arrange the notes into multiple charts.
Here, every group gets it's own chart. Within one chart, data points are colored by their Y axis property.

Separating by property will display a separate chart for each selected Y axis property.
Within a chart, data points are colored using a `Group by` sort (Base's `Sort` menu, top right).

## Runtime Debug Workflow

For contributors working with the streaming debug environment introduced in `.codex/steering/runtime-debugging.md`, run `bun run debug:runtime`. Use `bun run debug:runtime:dry-run` to exercise the orchestration without launching Bun or Obsidian. Append `--no-relaunch` if you want the harness to attach only to an already-running Obsidian instance; closing Obsidian while the workflow runs will leave the watcher in a “waiting-for-obsidian” state until you reopen it. The command exposes:

- A WebSocket feed (defaults to `ws://127.0.0.1:48321`) that streams `snapshot`, `event-batch`, and `tracker` payloads for automation clients.
- An optional interactive shell (`--interactive`) with commands such as `list`, `resolve <id> [note]`, and `tracker` to manage the runtime error queue.

Refer to the steering guide for the full workflow and troubleshooting tips.
